As I am not experienced with thread handling I will detail my understanding of how this could be handled.

Making the code "Thread Safe"
- I would look to add a simple lock on the "_bookings" list whilst executing the "AddBooking" method.
- This will avoid other threads updating the list at the same time.
- It would also ensure that any read methods (such as "IsRoomAvailable") will wait for the "_bookings" list to be updated before continuing.
